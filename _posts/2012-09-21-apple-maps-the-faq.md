> Unfortunately, like dialect recognition or speech synthesis (think Siri), mapping is one of those technologies that can't be fully incubated in a lab for a few years and unleashed on several hundred million users in more than a 100 countries in a "mature" state.

This explains why Apple just *had* to release Maps as soon as it possibly could. Yes, it doesn't just work. Yes, it is buggy. Yes, it seems un-'Apple'ey. However, this is a territory that has traditionally been far from Apple's core expertise and it requires a different approach to what Apple generally takes. 

I don't believe that Apple can perfect maps all by itself. It needs all the help it can get from it's users. How often have you seen 'Report a problem' mentioned so prominently on an Apple product?
