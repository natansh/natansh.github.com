title: Thoughts On The iOS 7 Redesign
---
> iOS 7 is the biggest change to iOS since the introduction of the iPhone. It is packed with amazing new features and a _stunning new user interface_.
> <cite>Tim Cook</cite>

As I listened to this, I had my hopes high. I _was_ expecting a new interface and Apple was going to unveil one. Tim Cook then started the design introduction video.

The design introduction was like a roller coaster ride. The lock screen looked incredible and it felt like the text was floating in space. That was delight, right there and it felt like Apple was going to present something extraordinary. I was pent up with anticipation that took quite a beating the next moment. 

As soon as the homescreen came on, I wasn't so sure anymore. I didn't like the icons one bit. However, just after that minor shock, I saw the Control Center - _it finally arrived!_ - and it looked nice but a bit cluttered. I wondered why the dividers between sections were so thick when most of the design elements were becoming _thinner_.  

After that, the icons were described individually and that by that time, I had taken out my own phone to compare. No, I liked the old ones better. Maybe I was being a bit too attached to the old and familiar but I felt that there was something wrong with the new icon set. I was getting a feeling of hatred - something I rarely get while using Apple products. Something was off and I was getting a sinking feeling that Apple hadn't really nailed it like they usually do. However, that was where my misgivings ended.

The Notification center was showcased which seemed to gel in really well with the overall aesthetic. The delight returned. Then they talked about the Parallax Effect. Even though I had seen the parallax effect at work before on a jailbroken iPhone, seeing Apple embrace it by default on the iPhone was great. The effect it generates is subtle but breathtaking! They cut to the Weather app which was drop-dead gorgeous. It was the pinnacle of Apple design, right there, with the incredibly detailed snow just falling and giving a feeling of depth in a flat phone. Amazing. Each of the built-in apps was run through and each seemed really well designed. I felt that Apple did have something going for them. That they had pulled off, almost flawlessly, a major change in the design language of their flagship operating system, even though the details could use more work.

2 days later, with the benefit of hindsight, I feel most of my gut reactions had been correct. Twitter search results showed that the redesign was appreciated by many but there was a unanimous disapproval of the new icon set. Many designers took to dribbble to redesign the icon set and I saw quite a few designs that I really liked. Joshua Topolsky, in his article - [The design of iOS 7: simply confusing](http://www.theverge.com/apple/2013/6/10/4416726/the-design-of-ios-7-simply-confusing) - pinpointed a number of inconsistencies in the visual design, many of which I agree with. However, the rider here is that iOS 7 is in beta and I really expect the design to be iterated upon and polished up with the difference being that this time, they might do it in the open. Hence, I am much more optimistic of iOS 7 being a great experience, come this fall.
