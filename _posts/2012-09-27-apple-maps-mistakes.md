> At Apple, we strive to make world-class products that deliver the best experience possible to our customers. With the launch of our new Maps last week, we fell short on this commitment. We are extremely sorry for the frustration this has caused our customers and we are doing everything we can to make Maps better.

This is what makes me admire Apple. They own up to their mistakes. No corporate-speak. Just plain, simple English.
