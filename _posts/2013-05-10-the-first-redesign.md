title: The First Redesign

![Before and After](/images/redesign_before_after.jpg)

I've been thinking for a long time about the in-your-face heading that I had put at the top. It didn't feel right and I felt the need for more subtlety. So I finally got down to making a few changes, nothing extravagant, just a few minor tweaks. Alongside, I also added sprites to make the site load faster, which was basically to satisfy the optimization geek in me.

I feel that the changes make the blog look cleaner and simpler now, even with the addition of a profile photo.
