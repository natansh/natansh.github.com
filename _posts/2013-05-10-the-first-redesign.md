title: The First Redesign

![Before and After](/images/redesign_before_after.jpg)

I've been thinking for a long time about the in-your-face heading I put at the top . I felt the need for a subtle header, so I finally got down to making a few changes. Nothing extravagant, just a few minor tweaks but alongside I also added sprites to make the site load faster, which was basically to satisfy the optimization geek in me.

I find that some subtle changes make the blog look much cleaner and simple, even with the addition of a profile photo.
