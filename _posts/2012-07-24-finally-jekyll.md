title: Finally, Jekyll
---

I've always tried to be simple about my blog design. Over at [Ions of Imagination](http://www.ionsofimagination.blogspot.com/), I actually managed it. This blog, however, has been a roller-coaster ride.

I started with Wordpress, building it's theme according to my personal tastes. Technical blogging on Wordpress, however, was very difficult. Finding Octopress, I thought my problems were solved. I was wrong. Octopress is good for out-of-the-box stuff, but customization is almost impossible. After a few hackish attempts at a major redesign of the default theme, I gave up and decided to chuck Octopress. It just wasn't solving my problems well enough.

Day before, I sat down and made a list of what I really needed from a blogging platform

1. Markdown Support
2. Code Syntax Highlighting
3. No dependence on a web-based interface
4. Posts as files rather than on DB
5. Support for heavy customization
6. Simple to understand workings

I decided to go really simple this time and went with the underlying platform to Octopress - Jekyll. It's as barebones as one can possibly go for creating a blog. Taking inspiration from [Daring Fireball](http://www.daringfireball.net/), [Dustin Curtis](http://www.dcurt.is/) and my previous theme, [Sense](http://www.github.com/natansh/sense), I made this theme. Still thinking of a name for it, but I like it for it's simplicity. The whole thing was hacked up in less than a day.

It's ridiculous that design held me back from writing, but it's good to be back.
