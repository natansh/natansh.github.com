>If you give in to "just this once," based on a marginal-cost analysis, you'll regret where you end up. That's the lesson I learned: it's easier to hold to your principles 100 percent of the time than it is to hold to them 98 percent of the time. The boundary—your personal moral line—is powerful because you don't cross it; if you have justified doing it once, there's nothing to stop you doing it again.

If you approach your moral line and are in a dilemma, these words make so much more sense. It is important not to cross that moral line because beyond that lies chaos from which it is almost impossible to get out.
