title: App.net vs WhatsApp
---

Dalton Caldwell launched a Kickstarter-esque campaign for building [App.net](http;//join.app.net) a Twitter without ads. I read his post related to the blog and loved it, but I didn't progress to actually backing the project.

The thing is, _$50_ is a ridiculous amount for a year of something is supposed to become a Twitter-like service. Twitter is valuable, it's fun, but it is not worth that amount. In my opinion, the best yardstick for comparing would be a service like WhatsApp, that charges _$2_ per year. Why WhatsApp? It's because that's the only paid service I have seen that has had any kind of popularity that a Twitter-like service would require. In comparison to WhatsApp, I think I'd be willing to pay maybe $5, with $10 a maximum limit for a service like Twitter.

However, assuming I pay _$5_, I can't see the network effects come into play with a paid application like this. In a place like India, that amount is a lot to part with, and worthy of much debate. My prediction is that the masses will stick to free, and most of my friends will too, which means even if I pay the money, I will end up with a raw deal. WhatsApp mitigated this by being dirt cheap - just a dollar at the beginning.

Finally, there's the switch. Why would someone switch from Twitter, which has become almost ubiquitous across the web and devices? People need reasons, and good ones. The new service has to do something different, or do the same thing way better. Whatsapp nailed messaging that rivalled the likes of BBM, but the killer punch was that it was cross-browser. App.net seems to have no such thing - it's just Twitter, maybe a bit worse. Of course, these are early days but I don't see anything that suggests that App.net will differentiate itself from Twitter.

Having said all of that, I sincerely hope that, if not App.net, then some other idea having a similar form succeeds. However, App.net doesn't seem to be it.
