The most important thing? 

Write _more_.

What's still broken with this blog?

1. The stylesheet has plenty of room for pruning.
2. There's redundant code for post template.
3. Archive page is not up to the mark. I didn't figure out what's going wrong with the font sizes.
4. Google Analytics isn't present yet. It was stupid to not have it ready in the first place.
5. jQuery is redundant for now. If I ain't using it, it's best to comment it out for now.

What are the _good to do_ plans?

1. Convert the styles to Sass + Compass.
2. Make the theme responsive and mobile-friendly.
3. Add a way to enable Github Flavored markdown.
4. Pagination.
5. Add icons for the navigation menu.
5. Package the theme for Jekyll Bootstrap, maybe.

NOTE: The working assumption according to which I am putting up this post is that I will go through with the steps I put down here, since I am writing them in public.
