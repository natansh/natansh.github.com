Quite a thorough article on [Counter Notions](http://www.counternotions.com) about what Apple hasn't done till date. One thing stood out for me - the stylus.
> Apple has successfully educated half a billion users in the art of multitouch navigation and general use of mobile devices. That war, waged against one-year old babies and 90-year old grandmas, has been decisively won. However, until Apple invents a more precise method, taking impromptu notes, sketching diagrams and annotating documents with a (pressure sensitive) stylus remains a superior alternative to the finger.

I still think that for an iPad to be a serious creation device, something similar to a stylus must exist. Combined with [high performance touch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOvQCPLkPt4), it would be awesome!
